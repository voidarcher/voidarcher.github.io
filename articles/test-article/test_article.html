        <p>
            This is just a test article. Hi there! If this is Ethan, then
            double hello, how's it going, dude. Hope your summer's going 
            okay, yadda yadda. Basically, all my articles are just going to
            be in this format, so I can just copy and paste this .html file
            whenever I want to make a new page. Saves me some work. I should 
            probably update this with an image just to get the totality of what
            this goddamn html-and-css-only-site might have. 
        </p>

            Hi there! This is a picture of Tux, the Linux penguin. He's a 
            very cute little guy.
